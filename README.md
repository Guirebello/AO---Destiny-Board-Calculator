# AO---Destiny-Board-Calculator


The python file its meant to be a quick implementation of this project idea. This project is meant to be done in javascript so that we can create an api out of it.

### Might Cause problems
- The weapon class having and `initial_level` and a `end_level` property might not be a good idea, because if we thing about what we want the final product to be, this is mixing the responsabilities. For now it can work, but for the future, if we want the user to put their current level of the weapons, having an end_level might not be a good idea. I see a case in wich its fine to have such properties, but is just something to keep an eye on
